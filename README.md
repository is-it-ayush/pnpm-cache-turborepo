a simple battries included turborepo starter.

you get eslint, prettier and a ui package out of the box. everything is cached
and the pipeline is already setup. you can configure it as you want. checkout
[package.json](./package.json) for commands. you also get nextjs (./apps/web)
but yeah you can replace it with vite or anything else you like tbh. although,
if you do so, make sure to change the eslint config too cause it includes the
"next" ruleset.

#### why.

it's mostly for me tbh, i forget things and having a place i could just yoink the
code from and start a new proejct seemed like a nice idea.

#### people who helped.

me, i did it. thank me.

#### license.
